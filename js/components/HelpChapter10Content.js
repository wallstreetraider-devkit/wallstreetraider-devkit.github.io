            <p>Wall ${'$'}treet Raider has a wide range of research features you can use, to help
            you find and manage your investments. Six buttons on the main screen are grouped
            together in the "Research" area, two of which ("Select Player" and  "Select Corp.")
            can be used to select the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')} that you
            wish to investigate, if you control the entity, that will be the entity that will
            do one or more transactions, as the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Transacting Entity')}.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Two other Research buttons are "Entity Info," which brings up a menu
            of research tools that focus on a particular company or on you, the player;
            and the "General" button for general research on a particular industry or
            comparisons of industries, or general economic data, plus certain other
            information or research tools. Finally, two additional buttons appear in
            this group, a "My News" button, to list headlines affecting you and your
            companies, and a "Select Last" button to reselect, as the
            ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, the corporate entity that
            was previously the Active Entity before the current selection.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>The functions of each of these six buttons, and the two research
            Menus that pop up when you click on the "Entity Info" or "General"
            research buttons, are discussed in the following  paragraphs.</p>
        </div>
        <br/>

        <div id="chap10_X(B)">
            <h3><strong>B. "SELECT PLAYER."</strong></h3>
            <br/>

            <p>This button provides a quick
            way for you to change the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}
            from a corporation to you, the player. Just click on this button
            and you become the Active Entity. After you do so, when you select
            any of the research or transaction functions, such as "List
            Portfolio" or "Buy Stock," the information shown in a research
            feature will be about you, or the entity doing a transaction
            will be you, as the Active Entity.</p>
        </div>
        <br/>

        <div id="chap10_X(C)">
            <h3><strong>C. "SELECT CORP."</strong></h3>
            <br/>

            <p>Click on this button
            to change the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')} being researched,
            or to select a corporation (that you control) that will do transactions.
            When you do so, an input box will pop up, and you can either type
            in the company's stock symbol (if you know it), and click on OK
            or the [RETURN] key, or else click on the "Look Up" button, to
            display a scrollable drop-list of all currently existing corporations,
            listed in alphabetical order. If you click on the "Look Up" button,
            you can then begin typing in the first 3 or 4 or more letters of the
            company's name, in order to jump quickly to the company's name/stock
            symbol in the list, and then either click on "OK" or press the [RETURN]
            key to select that company as the Active Entity.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>The Active Entity does not have to be a company that you control.
            Thus, once selected, you can do any of several types of research on it,
            by clicking on any of the "Research Report," "Earnings Report," "Credit
            Info" or "Financial Profile" buttons, and information for that company will
            instantly be displayed. However, if you go to a Transactions Menu while
            the Active Entity is a company you do not control, and you click on a
            transaction button, such as "Buy Stock," the entity doing the buying will
            be the LAST Active Entity you selected that you DO control (if you still
            control it), or if there was none, or you no longer control that company,
            the buying/selling (transacting) entity will be you, the player.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>This system greatly simplifies and reduces the number of necessary steps
            required to do a transaction, such as buying a stock. For example, if you
            control ABC Company, you might make it the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')},
            and check to see if it has available cash or credit to buy stock in another
            company. Then you could do some research on several companies, selecting each
            as ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, until you find one that you
            want ABC to buy, which we will call XYZ Corp. Once you have decided, you
            don't need to change the Active Entity back to ABC -- you can instead click
            on the "BUY / SELL" button to pull up the "Buy / Sell" transactions menu,
            click on the "Buy Stock" button, and the last company you have selected
            as "Active Entity," XYZ Corp., will have its stock symbols already displayed
            in the symbol entry box, as the stock that ABC is buying, so all you will
            need to do to initiate the trade is click on the "OK" button. (In effect,
            the program tries to "read your mind" and anticipate which company you
            are planning to buy, buy bonds of, merge with, etc., based on the last
            company whose Research Report or financial statements you viewed.)</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Notice that if you use the either the "SELECT PLAYER" button or the
            "SELECT CORP." button on the main menu screen when a Menu is open,
            doing so will close the Menu dialog.  Thus, unless you WANT to
            close a particular Menu dialog, you can instead use the "SELECT
            PLAYER" or "MY CORPS." buttons that also appear on each pop-up
            research or transactions Menu. Doing so will not just close
            the Menu dialog, but will instead close it and instantly
            reopen a new version of the Menu after you have changed the
            ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, revised to reflect
            the newly selected ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}.
            The Menu choices will differ considerably, depending on the
            type of entity: player, bank, insurer, holding/trading company,
            ETF, or other (industrial) company.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Notice that when you select a company as the "Active Entity," it will
            automatically be listed as one of the 15 companies on your "Streaming
            Stock Quotes" watch list, unless the list is already full or unless
            you have recently deleted that company from the watch list, in which
            case it will not be added back to the list</p>

            <h3><strong>D. "ENTITY INFO" BUTTON AND MENU.</strong></h3>
            <br/>

            <p>Click on this button
            to bring up a pop-up Menu with as many as 13 buttons on the right side
            of the Menu dialog box. Each of those buttons, if clicked, will display
            financial statements, research reports, or other types of information
            pertaining to the company or player that is the currently selected
            ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}. In addition,
            the dialog box will contain a text window, with instructions for
            using the Entity Info Menu (during the first year of a game
            only), and will give company information, such as its latest
            earnings (and trend), next quarter's projected earnings, who
            controls the company, and an analysis of the company's industry
            situation or an industry forecast (except for Holding/Trading
            Companies). Industry projections are only given for banks or
            insurance companies when there are somewhat extreme economic
            conditions.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>However, if the Active Entity is you, the player, and not a
            corporation, several of the buttons on this Menu will be absent
            or different, since there are no Research Reports, Shareholder lists,
            or quarterly Earnings Reports for individuals, only for corporations.
            Also, for an individual player, the text box on the left side of the
            Menu will contain different information than for a corporation --
            information about your personal tax liability and the estimated income
            tax you will owe for the current year, based on current and projected
            data.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>You can select any of the 16 buttons described below to obtain
            detailed financial and investment information about the currently
            selected "active  entity." Note that anywhere from 8 to 10 of the
            buttons listed below will appear on the "Entity Info" pop-up menu,
            depending on whether the currently selected ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}
            is a player, a holding company, a bank, an insurance company, or
            an industrial corporation (any corporation in any other industry).</p>

                <h4><strong>1. CHANGING THE ACTIVE ENTITY.</strong></h4>
                <br/>

                <p>At any time
                while you are viewing the "Entity Info" pop-up menu, if you wish
                to view information for another entity, click on the "Player"
                button near the bottom of the pop-up menu to select yourself as
                the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, or click on the
                "Select Corp." button, also at the bottom of the pop-up dialog,
                to select any corporation as the Active Entity. If you, the
                player, are the Active Entity, a "My Corporations" button will
                also be displayed. Clicking on it will display a list of only
                those corporations you control, from which you may select one
                by clicking on it. (If you only control one corporation, it will
                automatically become the Active Entity when you click on "My Corps.")</p>
                <br/>

                <p>As soon as you have made your new selection, the pop-up Menu
                will be re-drawn, and changed to reflect the newly selected entity.</p>
            </div>
            <br/>

            <div id="chap10_X(D)(2)">
                <h4><strong>2. RESEARCH REPORT.</strong></h4>
                <br/>

                <p>Click on this item to view a
                "research report" on the current ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')},
                if it is a corporation, and not you, the player.
                The research report is an analytical report on the company's
                financial performance and situation, as well as a
                recommendation as to the company's stock, if it is publicly
                traded, which will be either "Strong Buy," "Buy," "Hold," or
                "Sell."  Such recommendations tend to be right more often than
                not, but as in the real world, are frequently wrong, so you
                should not totally rely on the "Analyst's Recommendation" on
                any stock. As they say on Wall Street, "Those who know don't
                tell, and those who tell don't know."  So you still have to
                rely on your own judgment. Analysts tend to be inherently
                over-optimistic.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The Research Report will also include a listing of any
                recent news headlines that include the stock symbol of the
                company in question. The Research Report also includes a
                per-share earnings projection for the company, for the coming
                quarter. As in the real world, such "analysts' estimates" are
                often off the mark, especially in the case of diversified
                companies with numerous subsidiaries and other holdings, and
                tend to be more accurate for relatively simple companies
                engaged in a single line of business, with no subsidiaries or
                bond holdings, loans, etc., to muddy the waters. (Earnings
                projections are updated at least 2 or 3 times for every
                company during each quarter, or more often when the company
                is involved in certain major transactions, such as mergers.)</p>
                <br/>

                <p>This button is visible if the current ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}
                is a corporation. If the Active Entity is a player, this button is not
                shown. This button also appears (at all times) on the main
                Wall ${'$'}treet Raider screen, so you do not have to open the Entity
                Info Menu to access it. If you click on this button on the main
                screen when the currently selected Active Entity is you, the
                player, a Research Report will be displayed for the last company
                that had been the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, since
                there are no research reports on players, only on corporations.</p>

                <p>Click on this button to see
                a detailed financial profile of the currently selected "active
                entity" -- either the current player whose turn it is, or any
                corporation.  The profile will include a financial balance sheet,
                showing the value of the player or company's assets, the amount
                of any debts or other liabilities, such as accrued taxes of
                corporations, and the net worth of the player or company -- total
                assets minus total liabilities.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The "financial profile" will show a considerable amount of
                additional information about the player or company, which will
                vary, based on the type of entity (player, bank, insurance
                company, holding/trading company, or industrial company). Items
                shown for an individual player will include year-to-date taxable
                ordinary income or loss, the amount of any capital gains or
                capital losses, and the player's employment status and estimated
                (approximate) CEO salary, if any.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The profile for a bank will show as assets the totals of its
                business loans, consumer loans, and mortgage loans. As liabilities
                for a bank, the amount of its demand deposits, certificates of
                deposit (interest-bearing accounts), and interbank debt will be
                shown.  The profile for an insurance company will show as a liability
                the amount of its insurance policy reserves. Profiles for any
                industrial companies (those other than banks, insurers and
                holding/trading companies) will show as assets the company's
                Business Assets/Equipment, and its Working Capital (accounts
                receivable from customers and inventories, if any).</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Profiles for any player, bank or insurance company will show
                the amount of government bonds and corporate bonds, if any,

                <br/>

                <p>Depending on the type of corporation, certain variables
                that may be set by the controlling player are shown, such as
                the percent of sales or revenues spent on R & D or marketing;
                the dividend payout ratio, as a percent of net income; and
                (except for banks) the company's growth rate in investment
                in business assets, or growth rate in insurance in force
                (policy reserves) for an insurance company.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The financial profile for any corporation will show a number
                of other important items of information about the company, such
                as its earnings for the current year and the past four full years;
                net worth per share, and the current stock market price per share
                of its stock; the amount of any bonds issued and owed by the
                company, and the market price of such bonds; the number of shares
                of stock issued, and the "total stock capitalization" of the
                company -- the market value of all its stock.  Various other
                items shown for all types of companies include certain financial
                ratios, such as the price-to-earnings ratio for its stock,
                debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity, and, if the company is
                paying dividends on its stock, the dividend yield.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Other miscellaneous information is also given, such as a company's
                industry group category; who, if anyone controls the company;
                the country where the company is incorporated; the amount of any
                tax loss carryovers from prior years; and the amount of salary
                the company pays to its CEO or President. The main WSR screen
                shows the current day of the year and the day on which the next

                <br/>

                <p>If a company has issued bonds, a footnote will be provided
                at the bottom of the profile, giving details about the bonds,
                such as interest rate paid, yield at current market price, and
                when the bonds must be paid off. If there are antitrust lawsuits
                against the company, either pending or threatened, this will
                also be disclosed in a footnote.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Financial profiles for both players and companies provide
                credit information such as credit rating, ranging from "AAA"
                to "D"; the unused line of credit, if any, from the player's
                or company's lending bank; the interest paid on borrowings;
                and the name of the player or company's bank, from which it
                borrows. Also will be shown for a player is his or her
                employment status, either "Unemployed" or the name of the
                company of which the player is the CEO and the year in which
                the player first became CEO.</p>
                <br/>

                <br/>

                <p>On the "Industry Projection" information display, you will also
                see the current rate of growth in capacity (growth in business
                assets such as plant and equipment) for each company in the
                industry. The "Industry Projection" function also shows the
                percentage, if any, of sales or revenues being spent on productivity
                improvements, for each company in the industry being reported on.
                This expenditure would be for R & D (research and development)
                for companies in tech-oriented industries, or for marketing and/or
                advertising for companies in those industries where R & D spending
                is not relevant, such as retailing.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The projections of rate of return on capital assets are based on
                the anticipated rate of growth in demand for the industry's product
                and the planned rate of growth in supply (capacity) for all the
                companies in the industry, as well as the planned growth rate and
                productivity spending for the individual company. As such, these
                projections are never precisely accurate, since the industry demand
                growth projection can change at the drop of a hat, and since
                companies in the industry are constantly revising their capacity
                growth plans in reaction to changes in their own situation,
                industry demand, and in the economy.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>As in the real world, these types of projections can be
                very useful, but take them with a grain of salt. However,
                you can usually tell at a glance whether the growth in
                capacity is outstripping the projected rate of demand
                growth (or vice versa). For example, if all the major
                companies in an industry are planning to expand capacity at
                an annual rate of 30 to 40%, and projected demand growth

                    <p>NOTE: In Versions after 8.50, W${'$'}R has changed the way bonds
                    owned by banks or insurance companies are valued, on the
                    Financial Profile and in computing the net worth of the bank
                    or insurer. W${'$'}R now values bonds held by banks or insurers at
                    their tax basis (cost, as adjusted for any amortization of
                    bond premium or discount), rather than at their market value.
                    That is because it assumed that bonds will be held until paid
                    off at maturity. However, if bonds are "D"-rated, they will be
                    valued at market value, if the market value is less than their
                    tax basis. This change will smooth out much of the extreme
                    fluctuations in the net worth of banks and insurance companies
                    when interest rates are very high or very low.</p>

                    market value on the player's Personal Financial Statement and

                flow projection for a corporation, if the corporation is the

                for you, the player, if you are the currently selected "Active
                Entity." The projections go into considerable detail, although
                the income tax calculation is a rough estimate in some cases,
                when there are complex intercompany transactions between companies
                and their subsidiaries when they own 80% or more of the stock of
                the subsidiaries.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>In such cases, the fortunes of the subsidiaries (their
                taxable income or loss situation) may require the parent or
                the subsidiary to reimburse the other company for the tax benefit
                of its losses, or the sub will compensate the parent for the
                sub's taxable income that increases the tax liability of the
                parent, which is the only entity in the consolidated tax filing
                group that directly pays the consolidated group's income tax to
                the tax authority -- unless it is the 80% sub of another corporation,
                which can in turn be an 80% sub of yet another corporation and...
                you can see why this gets a bit too complex to forecast with
                any great accuracy. So, as the projection itself states, the
                income tax calculation may be a "rough estimate".</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The cash flow projection feature for corporations is a
                new one, appearing in versions after v. 8.72, and a related
                feature is that you may be given warnings, such as in Research
                Reports, of impending cash flow problems, where a company
                appears to be heading towards a situation in the next 3 months
                where it runs out of cash and cash equivalents (T-bills), and
                also has little or no bank line of credit to cover the projected
                cash deficits. In such cases, you will need to take various
                actions to conserve or raise cash, if you do not wish to have
                the company liquidate assets in forced sales.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Such actions you can take on behalf of the company may include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>issuing stock or bonds;</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li>selling off some superfluous assets;</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li>cutting (or completely eliminating) dividend payments;</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li>cutting productivity (R & D or marketing) spending; or,</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li>in the case of industrial companies, slashing the growth
                    rate (capital spending) of business assets to zero or less.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>

                <p>Also, when you increase productivity spending, the dividend,
                or the growth rate for a company you control, if the change
                will likely result in a forced liquidation of assets in the
                next three months, the cash flow diagnostic will instantly
                alert you of that fact, in which case you may want to reverse
                that changed setting, or take other ameliorative actions to
                prevent such a cash crunch.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>As a research tool, the cash flow projection can also be
                useful in identifying fast-growing, high-flying companies that
                are "burning" through a lot of cash and are projected to soon
                hit a financial wall when they run out of cash and bank financing,
                in which case such companies may be good short sale candidates,
                based on the expectation that they will soon have to "pull in
                their horns," so to speak.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>In versions after v. 9.05, corporate cash flow projections now
                show, as a subtotal, net cash flow before debt repayments, before
                arriving at the total (final) net cash flow. This is a more useful
                way of displaying the numbers, since in many cases some or all of
                the amount to be repaid can be borrowed right back, depending on
                a company's credit rating at the time repayment has been made.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The software function that computes and displays a corporation's
                cash flow projection is also utilized to diagnose a company's
                cash flow, whether it is positive or negative, and if negative,
                how serious it is. Thus, for any company in which you directly
                own stock or have a short position in the stock, or for any
                company that you control, the program may halt the stock ticker
                and display a cash flow alert if it appears a company in which
                you have such an equity interest is about to run out of cash and
                credit, and be forced to liquidate assets. Such warnings will not
                occur more frequently than once a quarter for a particular company,
                and once such a warning is given, it may not be repeated for a
                considerable time for that company.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Even if you don't have an equity interest in a company, if
                it is the current Active Entity or the most recent previously
                selected Active Entity, the cash flow warning may also pop up for
                such company, which may be helpful if you were studying the stock
                and considering investing in it or shorting it.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Note that if you control a lot of companies and are receiving
                frequent cash flow warning pop-up messages, that may become
                somewhat annoying. If so, go to the <em><strong>Settings</strong></em>
                pull-down menu at the top of the main screen and select the
                ${helpLink('chap05_V(B)(3)(g)', 'Suppress Cash Flow Warnings')}
                item to suppress such pop-up messages.</p>

                <p>The Cash Flow Projection button does not appear on the Entity Info
                Menu if the selected "Active Entity" is a bank. Banks are usually
                swimming in cash and other liquid assets and, in any case, are
                constantly receiving new deposits or loan repayments as customers
                earn money, or are lending out funds as customers draw on their
                lines of credit. In addition, banks are almost constantly buying
                or selling bonds or other financial assets (mortgages, consumer
                and business loans), in order to maintain a targeted level of
                liquidity, which would make cash flow forecasts miseading or, at
                best, meaningless.</p>

            <br/>

            <p>Click on this button to bring up a menu of "general" research
            features.  These functions are for doing general investment
            research (not on any particular company), such as economic
            data, tax rates, interest rates, news headlines, industry
            information, and various types of pre-configured database
            searches.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>The right-hand side of the "General Research" Menu that pops
            up has 12 buttons, each of which is a research tool described below.
            The left-hand portion of the dialog box contains a text box with
            instructions for using this Menu, and also contains other
            current information, such as central bank monetary policy and
            an analysis and a forecast for the currently selected industry
            (which can be selected from the "Industry Group Selected" drop
            list on the left side of the main screen, or by selecting a
            company in the desired industry group as the
            ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}).</p>
            <br/>

            <p>The text box also contains a textual analysis of the current
            state of the economy and forecast.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Besides doing research on industry groups or database
            searches for companies with largest market share or market cap,
            or companies with the largest cash hoards or tax losses, the
            functions on this Menu also provide a number of economic
            statistics and interest rate information that will help you to
            shape your investment decisions. Thus, for example, if interest
            rates are high and the Federal Reserve (or other Central Bank)
            is tightening the money supply, you may want to stay away from
            investments in stocks of companies that are sensitive to
            interest rates, such as housing development or building
            materials stocks. Or if the economy (Gross Domestic Product,
            or GDP, is the term used for the overall economy) is growing
            rapidly, various cyclical stocks like autos, steel, base
            metals, and airlines should usually do well.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Similarly, you need to be aware of trends in oil prices,
            since high oil prices tend to be detrimental to transportation
            industries such as airlines, trucking, shipping, and railroads,
            while low oil prices benefit those industries, and tend to
            eventually stimulate economic growth, as well. High oil prices
            tend to mainly benefit oil companies and oil service companies,
            though the resulting inflationary effects may also benefit the
            precious metals industry at times.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Several key indicators are updated every few seconds on the
            main Wall ${'$'}treet Raider screen, including the Prime Rate of
            interest charged by banks, yields on government bonds, crude
            oil prices, the economic growth rate, and the stock market index.
            For more details on economic indicators and interest rates, see

            <p>The various general research functions (buttons) on the

                <br/>

                <p>Clicking on this button does a database
                search in which all companies with a market share of 20% or more in their
                respective industries (not including banking, insurance or holding/trading
                company industries) are listed, ranked in order of their market share
                percentage, starting with the company with the largest market share. This
                is a good starting point for finding potential targets for anti-trust
                lawsuits.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Even if a company has well under 50% market share, and is thus
                not, by itself, a prime target for anti-trust suits, it may be under
                common control with other companies in the industry, which together may
                have a combined market share of 50%, 60%, or more. A quick way to find
                out if a company with a large market share (say 35%) is a potential
                target of an anti-trust lawsuit is to view a Research Report for the
                company. A ${helpLink('chap10_X(D)(2)', 'Research Report')} will tell
                you if a company, together with any "affiliated companies" (other
                companies controlled by the same player or company) in the same
                industry, have a combined market share of more than 25% in that
                industry and will also tell you what the combined percentage market
                share is.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Note that market share is not a relevant concept for banks, insurance
                companies, holding companies, or ETF's, in Wall ${'$'}treet Raider.</p>

                annual demand growth rate for 67 of them (not relevant for the 4
                financial industries), based on the current economic forecast,
                as well as the industry's expected long-term growth rate.  See
                ${helpLink('appendix_(D)', 'APPENDIX D')} for a list of industries'
                usual growth rates and basic characteristics relating to each

                <br/>

                <p>The list of industries will also show the current rate of return
                on capital assets (business assets, such as plant and equipment)
                for each non-financial industry, which in Wall ${'$'}treet Raider is the

                <br/>

                <p>If you click on this
                button you will see displayed, for the current "selected industry"
                group (shown as the "Industry Group Selected" on the left side of
                the main screen), a projection for each company in the industry of
                its rate of return on investment in "business assets" and its
                estimated market share percentage, projected 6 months into the
                future.  This screen also displays certain information that is also
                displayed in the "Industry Summary" projection, such as credit rating,
                price as a percent of net worth per share, and dividend yield, for
                each company shown.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>On the "Industry Projection" information display, you will also
                see the current rate of growth in capacity (growth in business
                assets such as plant and equipment) for each company in the
                industry.  The "Industry Projection" function also shows the
                percentage, if any, of sales or revenues being spent on productivity
                improvements, for each company in the industry being reported on.
                This expenditure would be for R & D (research and development)
                for companies in tech-oriented industries, or for marketing and/or
                advertising for companies in those industries where R & D spending
                is not relevant, such as retailing.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>The projections of rate of return on capital assets are based on
                the anticipated rate of growth in demand for the industry's product
                and the planned rate of growth in supply (capacity) for all the
                companies in the industry.  As such, these projections are never
                precisely accurate, since the demand growth projection can change
                at the drop of a hat, and since companies in the industry are
                constantly revising their capacity growth plans in reaction to
                changes in their own situation, industry demand, and in the
                economy.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>As in the real world, these types of projections can be
                very useful, but take them with a grain of salt.  However,
                you can usually tell at a glance whether the growth in
                capacity is outstripping the projected rate of demand
                growth (or vice versa). For example, if all the companies
                in an industry are planning to expand capacity at an
                annual rate of 30 to 40%, and projected demand growth is
                only 5%, it's a safe bet that that industry is going to
                have a severe problem of oversupply within a few months
                or calendar quarters, unless something changes very soon.</p>
                <br/>

                <p>Note that projections are not available for the banking,
                insurance and holding company industry groups. Thus the
                "Industry Projection" command button does not work when any
                of those three types of financial industries is the "selected
                industry." Also, when the Selected Industry is the Exchange-Traded

                <p>The "Industry Summary" command
                button, when it is clicked, gives you several comparative
                financial yardsticks for all the companies in a particular industry.
                For example, you can quickly view the book values (net worth) per
                share of each company in the industry you selected, since the
                display shows each company's book value per share as a percentage
                of its stock price per share. Also listed is each company's
                "P/E RATIO" (price-earnings ratio), its "RETURN ON EQUITY" (after
                tax earnings as a % of the company's current net worth), its
                dividend yield percentage, and current credit rating. In addition,
                for each company shown in the summary, the current "Analyst's Rating"
                (Buy, Sell, Hold, etc.) will be shown, if the company's stock is

                <br/>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u><em>Current Growth Rate, U.S. GDP:</em></u></strong> This is the
                    current annual rate of growth for U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"),
                    which is used in Wall ${'$'}treet Raider as a proxy for the growth rate
                    of the world economy.  This indicates how fast the world economy
                    as a whole is growing.  A normal growth rate in this simulation is
                    about 2.5% to 3.0%.  Note that the growth rate of demand for many
                    industries depends in large part on growth in GDP, so this is a
                    very important economic indicator.</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Prime Interest Rate:</em></u></strong> This is the rate
                    of interest that banks are currently charging on loans to their
                    best customers -- players or companies with "AAA" credit ratings.
                    Players or companies with lesser credit ratings pay higher interest
                    rates, as is detailed in ${helpLink('appendix_(C)', 'APPENDIX C')}.</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Prices of Government Bonds:</em></u></strong> The prices of
                    the government "long bond" (10 to 20 years maturity) and "short
                    bond" (0 to 10 years maturity) are shown, as well as the coupon,
                    or nominal interest rate on each.</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Annual Housing Starts:</em></u></strong> This figure is a
                    projection (in '000s of units) of annual housing starts, which is
                    obviously of great importance to the housing and building materials
                    industries.  A typical number for annual housing starts at the
                    beginning of a game is around 1,000 to 1,200 ('000), or 1.0 to
                    1.2 million.</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Corporate/Personal Tax Rates:</em></u></strong> Self-explanatory.
                    These are the current rates of tax paid by corporations and by
                    individual players. The rates for corporations and individuals vary
                    from time to time, ranging from about 20% to 50%.  Capital gains of
                    individuals are taxed at much lower rates than "ordinary income"
                    (salary, interest and dividend income). As in the real world, you
                    will find that although there is an occasional tax cut, tax rates
                    tend to rise over the years, since the government's need for money
                    (to attract or buy votes in the next election) is insatiable.</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Other Tax Rates:</em></u></strong> Self-explanatory.
                    Tax rates for any of six different types of taxes on capital
                    (when imposed) will be listed here, and footnotes below explain
                    each such tax. None of these taxes are ever imposed unless you
                    are playing at Difficulty Level 4 (in the recent versions of W${'$'}R).</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Crude Oil Price Per Barrel:</em></u></strong> Self-explanatory.
                    High oil prices are usually good for the oil and oil service industries
                    and not so good for the various transportation industries. An average
                    price for oil is ${'$'}100 (U.S.) per barrel (previously ${'$'}50 or ${'$'}35) in the
                    current version of this simulation. The price of spot crude oil in Wall
                    ${'$'}treet Raider is always quoted in U.S. dollars (the way OPEC prices
                    oil), even if you have configured a game for a different currency.</li>
                    <br/>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Global 1500 Stock Index:</em></u></strong> This is an indicator
                    of stock market prices, an average based on the prices of all of
                    the stocks of corporations in existence at any given moment, in
                    the Wall ${'$'}treet Raider database.  The index is a capitalization
                    weighted index.  That is, it is based on the value of the total
                    of the stock price times number of shares for every corporation,
                    added up, and then divided by a divisor.  The divisor is adjusted
                    each time any company issues new stock, such as in a startup, a
                    merger or public offering, or when it buys back its stock in an

                    <li><strong><u><em>National Debt:</em></u></strong> This item shows the total
                    amount of the government's national debt, represented by government
                    bonds issued, and grows throughout the game. (We won't say <em>which</em>
                    government's debt it is.)  Usually, this item is accompanied by a
                    footnote that shows the total amount of such debt currently held
                    by the players and corporations in the simulation.  The remaining
                    government debt is the amount of long- and short-term bonds that
                    are available for purchase from the public.  This figure is usually
                    not very relevant to you, unless you have trillions of dollars
                    (Euros, etc.) to invest, and want to buy government bonds, in which
                    case any purchase or sale of more than 1/2 of 1% of the "float" of
                    the bond you are buying or selling will be the maximum you can
                    trade without affecting the market price of the bonds.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The total national debt starts out as ${'$'}125 trillion (or equivalent
                    in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and grows at 6%. If you
                    are playing a version of the game that lets you play more then
                    35-year games, the national debt stops growing after 50 years,
                    at which point it will be about 18.4 times the initial amount.
                    This means that total holdings by players and companies may
                    eventually exceed the total amount of bonds issued by "the
                    government." In that case, trades are limited in size to
                    ${'$'}1 billion (U.S. dollars or equivalent). It is also possible,
                    but very unlikely, that total bond holdings could exceed the
                    national debt amount, in a shorter game of 50 years, or even
                    35 years.</li>

                <br/>

                <p>Click on this button to see what
                various key interest rates are at the moment. The different rates
                shown are as follows:</p>
                <br/>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u><em>Prime Interest Rate:</em></u></strong> This is the rate of
                    interest that banks are currently charging their best customers --
                    players or companies with "AAA" credit ratings.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>YTM:  Government Bonds:</em></u></strong> The "yield to maturity"
                    for both the "long" and the "short" government bond are shown.  These
                    are the percentage rates of return on both types of bonds at the current
                    bond price, if held to maturity, and are computed by using standard
                    discounted cash flow equations, but based on quarterly payments of
                    interest. (In the real world, most bonds pay interest semiannually, but
                    is becoming more common for bonds to pay quarterly or even monthly.)
                    If the price of a bond is below par (less than 100), then the yield on
                    the bond will be more than its nominal, or "coupon" yield; and vice
                    versa if the bond price is over 100.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Treasury Bill (T-bill) Rate:</em></u></strong> This is the
                    interest rate players and companies earn on their holdings of
                    Treasury bills, which are very safe short-term debt securities
                    issued by the government, which typically pay a very low interest
                    rate.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Bank CD Rate:</em></u></strong> This is the rate of
                    interest banks are currently paying on Certificates of Deposit
                    ("CDs"). In Version 8.50, players or corporations do not
                    hold CDs, but most of the bank deposits (usually around 90%)
                    held by the "Public" are in CDs, with only a small percentage
                    in DDs (demand deposits, that pay no interest).
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>SOFR Rate:</em></u></strong> SOFR stands for "Secured
                    Overnight Financing Rate," which, in the real world and in Wall
                    ${'$'}treet Raider, replaced the LIBOR ("London Interbank Offered
                    Rate") in 2023. This is the average rate of interest large banks
                    have to pay when they must borrow from another bank overnight.
                    Interbank loan transactions all take place automatically in
                    Wall ${'$'}treet Raider, so this is merely for your information,
                    in case you are wondering why a particular bank is doing so
                    well or so poorly. At times the SOFR interbank loan rate may
                    be well above or below the rate banks are earning on their
                    loan portfolios. In W${'$'}R, banks don't generally borrow from each
                    other unless they are out of cash and have sold off most or all
                    of their government bond holdings.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As real world news disclosed back in 2012, the LIBOR rate has
                    been rigged for years by crooks at 20 or more of the world's
                    largest banks, manipulated to increase their profitability on
                    various debt instruments.  Accordingly, in the real world, the
                    LIBOR rate was to be phased out at the end of 2021, possibly to
                    be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing (SOFR) Rate and
                    Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate, or possibly by other alternative
                    standard reference rates to be used in loan and interest rate
                    swap transactions. (In fact, the LIBOR rate has been phased out
                    in the real world after June 30, 2023 and generally replaced by
                    the SOFR rate and we have also replaced it with SOFR in this
                    simulation in 2023.)
                    <br/><br/>In Wall ${'$'}treet Raider, a "SOFR rate" is used only as
                    the rate at which banks pay interest on interbank loans, and is
                    loosely related to the Prime Rate and rates paid on CDs. Banks
                    with less-than-Sterling credit ratings will pay a rate somewhat
                    higher than the SOFR rate on their interbank borrowings in Wall
                    ${'$'}treet Raider.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Consumer Loans Rate:</em></u></strong> This is the average
                    rate banks are currently earning on consumer loans, such as car
                    loans and credit cards, and is usually several points higher than
                    the "prime rate" or the rate on mortgage loans.  This is because
                    there are frequent large bad debt charge-offs on a bank's
                    consumer loan portfolio, usually occurring about once a year,
                    which are often 3% or more of the consumer loan portfolio, so
                    the apparent high rate of return on these loans is somewhat
                    misleading, as the net return is about the same as on mortgage
                    loans, after bad debts write-offs are considered.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Prime Mortgage Rate:</em></u></strong> This is the
                    average rate banks are currently earning on mortgage loans, which
                    is usually just a bit higher than the "prime rate," since these
                    are pretty safe loans, with only small annual bad debt losses.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Subprime Mortgage Rate:</em></u></strong> This is the
                    rate banks and insurance companies are currently earning on
                    risky "subprime" mortgage loan securities, which generally pay
                    very high interest rates, but are very risky and have high
                    rates of default, resulting at times in massive bad debt
                    losses for the holders.</li>

                <p>In doing your investment
                research, looking for possible bargains, it is helpful
                in Wall ${'$'}treet Raider, as in the real world, to have the

                    in the textbox for this item. Thus, if you enter 10 (for a price-earnings
                    ratio of 10), the only companies that qualify will be those with P/
                    E ratios of 10 or less, based on the last calendar year's earnings. (If
                    you enter zero or less, the checkbox for this item will be turned off,
                    automatically.)

                    <li><strong><u><em>Stock Price Less Than x% of Net Worth:</em></u></strong>  If you
                    check this box, the database search will exclude from consideration any
                    company whose stock sells for more than the percentage entered in the
                    textbox for this item, in relation to its net worth per share. Thus, if
                    you enter 95%, and a company sells for 110% of its net worth per share,
                    it will not be included in the list of companies that meet your search
                    criteria. (If you enter zero or less, the checkbox for this item will
                    be turned off, automatically.)
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Dividend Yield Is x% or More:</em></u></strong>  If you check
                    this box, the only companies that will meet your criteria are those whose
                    dividend yield is equal to or higher than the percentage you enter in the
                    textbox for this item. (If you enter zero or less, the checkbox for this item will
                    be turned off, automatically.)
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Minimum/Maximum Market Capitalization:</em></u></strong>  If this
                    box is checked, the only companies that will meet your screening criteria
                    are those whose total market value is equal to or greater than the
                    minimum amount (in millions or billions) you enter in the minimum
                    capitalization textbox, and whose total market value is equal to or less
                    than the amount you enter in the maximum capitalization textbox for this
                    item. The default values are a minimum capitalization of 200 million,
                    and a maximum of 1,000 million.  Thus, for example, a company whose
                    total market value (of its stock) is greater than 1,000 million would
                    not meet your search criteria if you accept the default values. (If you
                    enter zero or less in either of the input boxes for this feature, the
                    value for that input item will be reset at the default value of 200 or
                    1,000, automatically.)
                    <br/><br/>
                    This screening factor is very helpful if you have only a certain
                    amount to invest, say ${'$'}2,000 million, and want to put most of it
                    into one company with a 20% ownership.  Thus you might set this
                    screen for companies with total market caps of about ${'$'}5,000 minimum
                    to about ${'$'}8,000 maximum, of which you could afford to buy 20% of
                    their stock.

                    <li><strong><u><em>Earnings Up Next Quarter by x% or More:</em></u></strong>  If
                    this box is checked, the only companies that will meet your criteria
                    are companies whose earnings are projected to be up by the percentage
                    you specify in the textbox for this item. This search factor is a
                    comparison of the earnings for the most recently reported quarter and
                    the current quarter (for which earnings have not yeat been reported),
                    so this is a very sensitive indicator of a company's changing fortunes.
                    (If you enter zero or less, the checkbox for this item will be turned off,
                    automatically.)

                    checked, the only companies that will meet your criteria are those whose
                    earnings have gone up in the last year, or the last 2 years in a row, or 3
                    years in a row, as you select. The textbox for this item is not editable,
                    but you can click on the 'Change' button to change the number of years to
                    1, 2, or 3, or back to 1. If this item is checked, the company must also
                    show a year over year quarterly earnings increase if it has reported
                    earnings for 1 to 3 quarters of the current year, or it will be treated
                    as not meeting this test.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Management Rated at Least:</em></u></strong>  If this box is
                    checked, you can select only companies that, relative to others in their
                    industry, are considered to have Good, Average, or Poor management. Use
                    the "Change" button to select one of the above. If you select "Good," then
                    only companies with good management will meet your test. If you select
                    Average, then companies with either "Average" or "Good" management will
                    qualify.  If you select "Poor," it is the same as not checking the box
                    for this item, since all companies have at least "Poor" management, if
                    not better.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Credit Rating Is at Least:</em></u></strong>  If this box is
                    checked, the database search only picks out companies that have at least
                    as good a credit rating as listed in the box for this item. While the
                    textbox is not editable, clicking the 'Change' button will change the
                    credit rating displayed, which ranges from lowest minimum of D, to C,
                    to CC, to CCC, to B, to BB, to BBB, to A, to AA to the highest credit
                    rating, which is AAA.  If you select this search factor, note that the
                    list of companies that will be displayed will show the credit rating
                    for each, with the companies sorted alphabetically. In versions after
                    Version 9.05, when searching for stocks to trade, if you check the
                    Credit Rating box, the list of companies that is displayed will be
                    sorted by credit rating, rather than alphabetically.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Similarly, if you are doing a bond search, the bond issuers that
                    will be displayed will be sorted based on credit rating. However, in
                    Versions 9.0 and later, that is only the case if you have checked the
                    Credit Rating box -- otherwise, the bond issuers will be sorted by
                    the maturity date of the bonds, making it easy to find very short-term
                    or very long-term bonds, depending upon what you are looking for.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Analyst Rating is:</em></u></strong>  If this box is checked,
                    the database search only picks out companies that have the stock
                    analyst performance and valuation rating as listed in the box for
                    this item. While the textbox is not editable, clicking the "Change"
                    button will change the rating level displayed, which ranges from
                    highest of "Strong Buy," to "Buy," "Hold," "Sell," and the lowest
                    rating of "Strong Sell." Note that as in real life the Wall ${'$'}treet
                    Raider stock analyst's ratings are not always that reliable, but
                    this still can be a useful addition to other criteria you are using
                    to find a company to invest in, by selecting only stocks with the
                    "Strong Buy" or "Buy" rating. Or, if you are looking for short
                    sale candidates, use this criterion to search for companies with
                    "Strong Sell" or "Sell" ratings.

                    <li><strong><u><em>Exclude Financials, Holding Companies, or If You
                    Control:</em></u></strong> If this box is checked, the database search
                    will exclude the stocks of banks, insurance companies, holding
                    companies, and stocks of any companies you already control. Thus,
                    the only companies whose stocks or bonds will be displayed are
                    those of industrial companies that you do not control.

                    <li><strong><u><em>Industry Supply/Demand Improving:</em></u></strong>  If this box
                    is checked, companies in any industry where the supply/demand situation
                    is not improving or stable will be excluded, except that this factor
                    applies only to 'industrials,' and not to banks, insurance companies, or
                    holding / trading companies. None of the three latter groups of
                    companies will be excluded due to your checking this factor. However,
                    you may choose to exclude such financial stocks by checking the box
                    described in the preceding paragraph.

                    <li><strong><u><em>Search One Industry: (Select Industry To Search):</em></u></strong>
                    If this box is checked, you can narrow your search further by limiting
                    it to companies in one industry (other than Exchange-Traded Funds -- ETFs).
                    When you check this box, a list of all 70 industries will pop up and
                    you can pick the industry you want to search. For example, if you want to
                    only search for banks whose earnings are projected to rise by 10% or more
                    next quarter, you would click on this box to limit your search to banks.
                    But if you limit your search to any of either the banking, insurance, or
                    holding/trading company industries, remember to uncheck the box that
                    excludes financial companies and holding/trading companies; otherwise,
                    your search will turn up zero companies, as the two settings will cancel
                    out each other if both turned on.

                    <li><strong><u><em>Has Positive Cash Flow.</em></u></strong> Check this box
                    if you want to find companies that are projecting positive cash
                    flow for the next three months. The companies that have positive
                    cash flow tend to be companies that are very healthy and able to
                    reduce their debt levels, if any, which may make them attractive
                    investments. However, if you want to also select companies that
                    have negative cash flow, but that have positive cash flow before
                    taking into account required debt repayments, check the following
                    item (or both it and this item).
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>... Or (Has Positive Cash Flow) Before Debt Repayment.</em></u></strong>
                    Checking this box will exclude from the list of selected companies
                    those that are projected to have negative cash flow for the next
                    three months, even before making required debt repayments, but will
                    not exclude companies having negative cash flow overall, but positive
                    cash flow before their required debt payments (paying off bank
                    lines of credit or paying off bonds that come due in the next
                    three months). In short, the companies that meet this criterion
                    are those generating net cash flow from operations, but the amount
                    of debt repayments they must make in the coming three months is
                    greater than the amount of cash that will be generated from
                    operations. Thus, such companies will generally be paying down
                    their debts, but in doing so may be depleting their cash and
                    cash equivalents or may be incurring cash and cash equivalent
                    deficits due to debt repayments, which will cause them to either
                    draw on their line of credit and borrow back part of the loan
                    payment they made or, if they have no remaining line of credit,
                    will be forced to liquidate some of their assets in order to make
                    the loan repayment or bond payoff.

                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Even if either or both of the above cash-flow factors

                    above search criteria are designed to help you find good stocks to
                    buy, this feature looks for stocks that you are more likely to
                    profit from if you sell them short, rather than acquire them. For an
                    explanation of what it means to sell a stock short, see the
                    ${helpLink('chap03_III(P)', 'FAQ on Short Sales')} in Chapter 3. Clicking
                    on this item on the Database Search menu screen will search for and
                    generate a list of stocks of companies that are likely to be good
                    stocks to sell short.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Use this item software to do a "smart" search of companies that have
                    certain negative characteristics that indicate that their stocks
                    may be headed down soon, and that you may want to consider selling
                    short. Alternatively, you may instead want to buy put options on
                    such stocks, which is another way to take advantage of a decline in
                    a stock's price. The program considers and weighs a number of factors,
                    such as stock price momentum, earnings decreases, high price-to-net
                    worth ratios, high (or infinite) price-earnings ratios, bad credit
                    ratings, and negative cash flow projections. If enough such negatives
                    are found, the company's stock will be selected and displayed on the
                    list of short sale candidates that you will be able to pick from.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Note that, with a few exceptions, such as for market cap,
                    exclusion of financial companies, and limiting search to a
                    single industry, any other items you have selected, such as
                    dividend yield or improving industry supply-demand conditions,
                    will automatically be de-selected if you check this item. That
                    is because all the other search criteria you may have selected
                    are looking for "good" companies, while the search for short
                    sale candidates looks for "bad" or overpriced companies. Thus,
                    if both types of search criteria were selected, no companies
                    would qualify as both "good" and "bad."

                    Sometimes you may be thinking of investing in a stock
                    that appears to be very cheap, perhaps tottering on the edge
                    of bankruptcy reorganization, but you feel it may be a good
                    investment if it turns around. It may be, but you may want
                    to think twice about acquiring it if it shows up on a list
                    of short sale candidates, using this database search function,
                    since the simulation considers a lot of factors with regard

                    search will exclude from consideration any company that does not have
                    a bond issue outstanding. You would generally check this item only
                    if you are looking for good corporate bonds to invest in, and perhaps
                    select only a few other criteria, such as credit rating, good
                    management, and whether or not the industry supply/demand situation
                    is improving for a given bond issuer. Factors like P/E ratio or Price
                    to Net Worth would not be very relevant if you are doing a search for
                    corporate bonds to invest in.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you select this factor, the list of companies displayed will
                    show the bonds' credit rating and the year they mature. Checking
                    this box causes the search routine to assume you are interested
                    only in finding corporate bonds to invest in, rather than stocks
                    (though many of the criteria, such as credit rating, earnings
                    trends, and the like, may be the same for both stocks and bonds).
                    Thus, if you have checked this box, the listing of corporate bonds
                    will show a number of bond details, such as interest rate, yield
                    to maturity, date of maturity, credit rating, the amount issued,
                    and the amount in public hands that are available for purchase, and
                    the list of all bonds that meet your criteria will be displayed in
                    descending order of their credit rating. An asterisk (*) will
                    appear after the credit rating of any bond issue that is a
                    convertible bond (convertible into stock of the issuing company).
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong> If you check this box, to search for bonds, the
                    database search program will automatically UNcheck the box below it
                    that is for showing convertible bonds only.
                    <br/><br/></li>

                    <li><strong><u><em>Show Convertible Bonds (Only):</em></u></strong> Clicking
                    on this box will automatically UNcheck the "Has Bonds Issued and
                    Outstanding" box immediately above it, since this item is for
                    showing convertible bonds, only. When this box is clicked, a message
                    will pop up, asking you if you want to ignore the conversion prices
                    of the convertible bonds, or if you have set a conversion premium
                    limit, it will ask if you want to change that limit. If you choose
                    to ignore the conversion prices of convertible bonds (or enter
                    zero to change a prior premium setting greater than zero), then
                    the search program will display ALL convertible bonds that are
                    publicly traded, unless you have set some other search criteria,
                    such as credit rating or analyst stock rating, that disqualify
                    some of the companies that have issued convertible bonds.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If, instead, you choose to exclude bonds that are trading at
                    a large premium over their conversion value, you can enter that
                    percentage, which can be 1% or any higher percentage, like 300%.
                    If, for example, you enter 30%, the search program will exclude
                    any convertible bonds that are trading at a price that reflects
                    a premium of more than 30% over the value of the bonds if they
                    were to be exchanged for stock at that moment. This is useful,
                    since convertibles that trade at a very large premium, like
                    100% or more, above their conversion value will have only a minor
                    price response, if any, to changes in the underlying stock, and
                    may only go up 15% or 20% or so even if the stock doubles. Such
                    a "busted convertible" trades more like a non-convertible bond
                    unless or until the stock it converts into makes a major up move.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As an example, if XYZ's convertible bonds are convertible into
                    20 shares of stock for each ${'$'}1,000 face value bond, and the stock
                    sells for ${'$'}37.50 a share, the "conversion value" of the bond is
                    only ${'$'}750 per ${'$'}1,000 bond, or a bond price of 75. If the bonds
                    are trading at 100, rather than 75, the "conversion premium" in
                    the price of the bonds would be 25 points, or 33.3% above the
                    bonds' conversion value of 75. So if you have chosen to exclude
                    bonds trading at more than a 30% premium from the search, the XYZ
                    bonds would not meet your search criteria, and would not be shown.
                    By using a relatively low premium percentage, like 15% or 20%,
                    you can zero in on bonds that will behave, price-wise, much more
                    like the underlying stock, if the stock rises.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>

                <p>Once you have selected all the factors you want to apply in your
                search, and if the number of companies that qualify is greater than zero
                but not more than 1,000, click on the "Display Results" button to view the
                list of companies that meet your criteria. You can then double-click on
                any such company to select it as the 'Active Entity,' for doing further

                <p>Note that when you exit the Database Search function, and re-enter it
                later, your search criteria are preserved from before (but the number of
                companies that now qualify will probably have changed). Thus, once you
                have selected what you consider a good set of search parameters, you can
                periodically click on the Database Search button and see what companies,
                if any, newly fit the search parameters you have determined. There is
                also a "Recall DB Search List" button in this same group of "Quick Search"
                buttons, which you can click on to instantly bring up your search list
