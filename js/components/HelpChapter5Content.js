            <h3><strong><em>A. IN GENERAL</em></strong></h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Once you have entered players' names, decided on the length of
the game and players' turns and other preliminaries, you will find
that most of the time you spend playing Wall $treet Raider will be
spent on the "main menu" (the screen titled as "Trading Desk")
portion of the program, except when you are in the various research
or transactions pop-up Menus that you will use to do your
investment research, or to buy or sell stocks, bonds, or business
assets or to engage in other types of transactions.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>This chapter describes the workings of the various main menu
or "Trading Desk" features, other than the transaction command
buttons and research buttons. The features discussed in this
chapter are mainly pull-down menus used to start, end or save
games, or configure the game in various ways, plus the various
informational items displayed on the main screen, and certain
miscellaneous buttons, other than those that are in the "Research,"
"Transactions," or "Other" button groupings.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Research functions, such as viewing financial statements,
earnings reports, research reports, and industry and economic
data and forecasts, are mostly accessed by clicking on the buttons
in the "Research Tools" grouping or the "Quick Search Functions"
grouping on the main screen. The "Select Player" and "Select
Corp." buttons are used to select the player or corporate
${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')} whose information
is to be viewed with certain of the research command button features, as well as for doing
transactions. The other two Research buttons bring up pop-up
Menus, either for doing research on a specific entity
(player or company), or general industry and economic research.
For instructions on using the program's research features in
the "Entity Info" and "General" (research) Menus, see
${helpLink('chap10', 'Chapter X')}.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Transactions, such as buying and selling, are all done in the
various Transactions Menus, which are accessed by clicking on
any of the six "Transactions" buttons, which appear together in a
group on the main "Trading Desk" menu. The "Buy Stock" and
"Sell Stock" buttons also appear in the Menu that is brought
up by the "Buy/Sell" button, unless the current ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}
is a player, rather than a corporation controlled by the player.
These two frequently used buttons are placed on the main screen
in order to make it possible to access the buy- and sell-stock
functions with a single keystroke.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>For instructions on using commands in the various Transactions
Menus, see:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 24px;">
                <li>${helpLink('chap06', 'Chapter VI (Buy/Sell)')}</li>
                <li>${helpLink('chap07', 'Chapter VII (Financing)')}</li>
                <li>${helpLink('chap08', 'Chapter VIII (Management)')}</li>
                <li>${helpLink('chap09', 'Chapter IX (Other Transactions)')}</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>Three more buttons, the "End Turn," "Stock Chart," and "Misc"
buttons, are located together in the "Other" section, on the far
right side of the main screen. The "End Turn" button ends the
current player's turn prematurely, and the "Stock Chart" button
displays a stock price chart for the mostly recently selected
(corporate) ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, while
the "Misc" button brings up a Menu of additional transactions
or functions you can do, but which do not count against the 5
transactions (10 in the "alternative version" of W$R) that you are
allowed on each turn. The "End Turn," "Stock Chart," and "Misc"
buttons and the functions available on the pop-up menu that
appears when you click on the "Misc" button, are all discussed
in ${helpLink('chap11', 'Chapter XI (Other Menu Functions)')}.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Note that the stock ticker runs across the bottom of the
screen while you are looking at the Main Menu, and that various
news headlines (including some earnings reports) are constantly
scrolling through a text box in the middle of the main screen,
if the stock ticker is moving (and occasionally will move even
when the stock ticker is halted).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Also displayed, just above the news headlines ticker, are
information items that include the name of the player whose
turn it is at present, the current game date, and the number
of transactions that can be done before the player's turn
ends (which is reduced by one at the mid-point and again at
the end of each calendar quarter). Now let's look at each
of the various Main Menu features, other than the "Research
Tools," "Transactions," and "Other" groups of command buttons.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>The main screen or "Trading Desk" of Wall $treet Raider contains four
pulldown menus -- the "File" menu, the "Game Options" menu, the "Settings" menu,
and the "Help" menu. Any of the 4 menus can be accessed by clicking on the menu
name (File, Game Options, Settings, or Help), or, by using the keyboard, by
pressing the "Alt" key and then pressing the underlined first letter of the
menu name (F, G, S, or H).</p>

                <br/>
                <p>The File Menu is located in the upper left corner
of the main Wall $treet Raider screen. It has the following menu items which
you may select by clicking on them:</p>
                <br/>

"New Game" menu item (or press "N" key while viewing this pulldown menu)
to start a new game. This item will instead appear as "Restart" after a
new or saved game data set has been loaded into memory. Clicking on the
"Restart" item (or pressing the "R" key while viewing this pulldown menu)
will cause the current or just-finished game data to be dumped from
memory, and a new copy of W$R to be loaded into memory, so you can then
either start another new game, or load and resume playing a saved game.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p id="chap05_V(B)(1)(b)"><strong><em>Open Saved Game.</em></strong> Click on this menu item (or press "O"
key while viewing this pulldown menu) to continue a saved game. When you do so,
the program will ask if you want to continue a game number such as "Game #1" --
which will be the last game file you saved to disk. If you answer "No," you
can then enter the number of the game you wish to load, which can be any
number from 1 to 50 that has been assigned to a game you were playing previously.
This item will be grayed out (and unavailable) after a new or saved game data
set has been loaded into memory.</p>

while viewing this pulldown menu) to save the current game to disk, as the
game number that has been selected by you or assigned by the program, in the
case of a new game. This item will be grayed out (and unavailable) until a
new or saved game data set has been loaded into memory, or once a game has
ended. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SAVE A GAME WHILE YOU ARE IN THE MIDST OF DOING
A TRANSACTION, AS THE SAVED DATA MAY REFLECT ONLY PART OF THE UNCOMPLETED
TRANSACTION.</p>

the game number you will select (which must be from 1 to 50). This item
will be grayed out (and unavailable) until a new or saved game data set
has been loaded into memory.</p>
                    <br/>

key while viewing this pulldown menu) to exit the Wall $treet Raider program.
You can also exit without using this menu item, by pressing the "Alt" key and the
"F4" function key at the same time, at any time while you are viewing the main
Wall $treet Raider screen. Note that the game you are playing at present will
not automatically be saved when you exit the program. You will need to select
the "Save" or "Save Game As" menu item to save the game to disk, before you
exit the program, if you wish to continue playing the current game at a later
time, at the point where you left off.</p>

which the stock ticker and news ticker move across the screen when the
ticker is running. You can select a speed setting of anywhere from 1 to 100,
where 1 is the slowest speed and 100 is the fastest. The faster the ticker

fast. Dirty money. Of course, there may also be consequences if you choose

on very large amounts of a commodity, with only a 5% margin requirement,
you had better have a large amount of cash or credit if you set the "Take
Physical Delivery" setting as "Yes," since you will need to pay the
full contract price when a futures contract you own is settled at its
expiration date.</p>

this item in order to set a
maximum business asset growth rate percentage (which can be
a negative value) for all of the industrial companies that

items of information about the current ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')},
which can be either the current player whose turn it is, or any corporation you
have selected for viewing or (if you control the corporation) for action. The
items displayed in this box all relate to that entity, except the "GO" button,
which is used to select a company as Active Entity if you have entered its stock
symbol into the "Stock Symbol" text entry box.</p>
                <br/>

                    <p><strong><em>"Entity Name."</em></strong> The name of the ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')} --
player name or corporation name -- is shown just under the "Active Entity Selected"
label.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>"Stock Symbol."</em></strong> The "Stock Symbol" text box shows the
stock symbol of the currently selected ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, if it is a corporation.
If it is the player, the box will display "N/A" -- meaning "not applicable."
This box can also be used to directly enter a stock symbol to select a
particular company as ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}, if you know the stock symbol.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>"Stock Price."</em></strong> This box shows the stock price of the
currently selected Active Entity if it is a corporation. The price is
automatically updated when the stock ticker is running, any time the price
of the company's stock changes.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>"Controlled By" Item.</em></strong> This item shows the stock
symbol of the company that controls the currently selected ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')},
if the Active Entity is a corporation. Click on it to select that company
as the new ${helpLink('chap03_III(A)', 'Active Entity')}.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>"Acting Now."</em></strong> The "Acting Now" item shows
the name or stock symbol of your controlled company that is currently
doing transactions (which may or may not be the Active Entity); or, it
will show "Me" if you are the entity that will do a transaction.</p>

constantly, so that any fluctuations in the prices of stocks or bonds you own
directly will instantly show up on your "balance sheet."</p>

player's cash balance (actually non-interest-bearing bank demand deposits, or
DDs, which pay no interest to the depositor.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>However, this cash is generally quite safe, except in the rare case
where your bank collapses and the government requires a "bail-in" of large
depositors, so that you lose part or all of whatever you had on deposit
with that bank. Thus, if your bank looks shaky, you
may want to go to the "Other Transactions" Menu and change banks, for both
loans and deposits, before your bank goes bust.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>Other Assets.</em></strong> This item shows the current market
value of all the player's other assets, such as T-bills, stocks, bonds,
and options, plus any advances (demand loans) made to corporations by
the player. Of course, if you try to sell a large block of stock or
corporate bonds, you will depress the price of the security, so you
will have to sell it for somewhat less than the market value.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>Total Assets.</em></strong> This is the total of your assets,
including cash (bank demand deposits) and all "Other Assets."</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>Less Debt.</em></strong> This item shows the amount of your
debt owed to the lending bank, and is shown as a negative number, if
you owe anything to the bank.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>Net Worth.</em></strong> This item is your bottom line net
worth. It is the sum of your cash and all your stock and bond
investments, less any loans you owe to the bank. Click on this
item to see a historical chart of your net worth for the past five
years of game play.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Note that if, at any time, your net worth is less than 1/3 of what you
owe the bank, you will soon receive a ${helpLink('chap03_III(I)', 'margin call')} from the bank, forcing you to pay down the loan to where it is
no more than 3 times your net worth.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>If your "net worth" falls below zero, you will generally go
bankrupt, and be forced out of the game.</p>

zero, by entering a positive or negative amount into a small dialog
box that will pop up.</p>

Wall $treet Raider, and are finding it difficult to build your
net worth to a size where you can take over some large
companies and do great things. By adding up to $1 trillion

experiment with running large corporate empires, sort of like
"training wheels" on a bicycle.</p>
