const LORE_SNIPPETS = [
    "In 1967, a Harvard Law student began filling notebooks with ideas for a board game simulating all of American capitalism. It took 16 years for personal computers to catch up with his vision.",
    "A Disney game studio tried for over a year with a team in Armenia. Commodore mailed the source code back after three months. For 40 years, the code was indecipherable to anyone but its creator.",
    'A hedge fund manager wrote: "I played Wall Street Raider for years and started doing what I\'d been doing in the game with my real clients." His Price Waterhouse audited 10-year return: 44% compounded annually.',
    "At 3 AM, Jenkins would race to encode financial logic before understanding slipped away. The result: code that worked perfectly for decades, yet even he no longer fully comprehended.",
    "Over 200 CEOs and investment bankers have credited Wall Street Raider with shaping their careers \u2014 from a teenager in the Philippines playing the free demo to a forex trader at Morgan Stanley in Shanghai.",
    '115,000 lines of code written by forty distinct versions of Michael Jenkins, competing across four decades, governed by what one developer described as "laws written on top of laws that were interpreted wrong."',
    "A player from the Philippines: \"I've been playing since I was 13, living in a third world country. Couldn't even afford the full version. I played the two-year demo for years. It taught me so much that now I'm working for Morgan Stanley.\"",
    'In 1983, Jenkins sat at a Kaypro computer with a five-inch screen, typed 10 PRINT "HELLO", and realized: "This isn\'t that complicated." He stayed up until 5 AM writing code. Four decades later, he still hadn\'t stopped.',

      Wall Street Raider exists because a small handful of people refused to let it disappear.
      The game has been in continuous development for over forty years, and the Steam Edition
      you are playing today is the result of decades of devotion from its creator, the
      patience of an online community that kept the flame alive, and a circle of friends and
      collaborators who gave their time, their talent, and their honest feedback without ever
      asking for a thing in return. To everyone listed below, and to every player who has
      ever opened a save file and lost a weekend in the pursuit of imaginary profits: thank you.

      <div class="wsr-credit-name">Michael Dodd Jenkins</div>
      <p class="wsr-credit-body">
        The original developer of Wall Street Raider, and has been since 1984. He wrote the
        first version on a Kaypro II in Microsoft BASIC, pouring everything he had learned as
        a tax attorney about markets, dealmaking, accounting, and corporate maneuvering into
        a simulation that no one else has come close to matching. For four decades he has
        carried this project alone, line by line, refining the engine and the worldview
        behind it. Thousands of business and financial professionals around the world have
        credited his game with shaping how they think about capital, risk, and ownership.
        Wall Street Raider is, and will always be, his.

      <div class="wsr-credit-name">Benjamin Ward</div>
      <p class="wsr-credit-body">
        Lead developer of the Remastered / Steam Edition. A senior software engineer with a
        background in modern web applications and a deep affection for old programming
        languages, Ben spent years figuring out how to wrap a 1980s PowerBASIC simulation
        engine in a contemporary user interface without rewriting a single line of the
        original game logic. Every menu, chart, and modal in the new client is a love letter
        to Michael's work and to the players who have lived inside it.

        The official composer of Wall Street Raider. A teaser of his score appears in the
        most recent game trailer, with more on the way. Brenden is giving the game an
        auditory identity to match the depth of its simulation, and the result will be the
        first dedicated soundtrack in the game's forty-year history.

        Editor-in-Chief of Outsider Gaming, and the reason this remaster exists at all. It
        was his Reddit post that first introduced Ben to Wall Street Raider, and it was that post that gave Ben the courage to reach out to Michael about
        modernizing the game. AJ has since produced and distributed multiple interviews with
        both developers, ensuring that the story of the game and the people behind it is

        The original Wall Street Raider content creator. Across hundreds of hours of patient,
        in-depth YouTube videos spanning many versions of the game, he taught countless
        players how to actually play, and gave the community something to gather around when
        there was nothing else. There is a real and direct line between his channel and the
        existence of the Wall Street Raider community today.

      <div class="wsr-credit-role">Original and Current Lead Community Manager</div>
      <p class="wsr-credit-body">
        While working two jobs, Schlongsworth volunteered his time to build and moderate the
        Discord server, and the culture, tone, and structure of the community there is
        essentially his own creation. He has spent untold hours talking with Ben about
        marketing strategy, community development, and what other game communities get right,
        and he has been the steady voice of reason on direction, scope, and pace. The Wall
        Street Raider community is as strong as it is because Schlongsworth chose to give it
        his time.

      <div class="wsr-credit-role">Lead Moderator, Master of Quality</div>
      <p class="wsr-credit-body">
        Malor brought decades of game knowledge to every beta build, hunted bugs across
        versions that no one else would have noticed, and held the project to a standard the
        original game would recognize. He has been, along with Michael himself, the most
        reliable litmus test for whether a proposed change fits the spirit of Wall Street
        Raider, and his refusal to let small things slide is a large part of why this
        version is shipping at the quality it is. He gave the project his time so that the
        game he loves could be delivered to the next generation of players.

      <div class="wsr-credit-role">Lead Moderator, Master of Morale</div>
      <p class="wsr-credit-body">
        From the very beginning, Daisy showed up as a veteran player whose mastery of the
        original game gave her advice real weight. She drove internal conversations about
        priorities, gameplay feel, and where the remaster needed to close the gap with the
        classic experience, and she did it while keeping the team optimistic through long
        stretches that were anything but easy. Her steady presence helped this project
        survive its hardest months.

      <div class="wsr-credit-role">Lead Moderator, Master of Hype</div>
      <p class="wsr-credit-body">
        The first content creator to volunteer to showcase the beta on his YouTube channel,
        and watching a long-time fan of the original game enjoy the new interface, on
        camera, was the kind of motivation no roadmap can provide. Trim has also been a
        core participant in internal discussions about direction and priorities, and a
        tireless advocate for the project to the wider audience.

        r3y_j04n has put in the hours that most players never see, working through builds,
        surfacing issues, and giving the kind of grounded, repeatable feedback that turns a
        beta into a release.

        justin showed up for two months. With backing from his two friends, he vibe-coded a

        it was offered, hit a trillion dollars of net worth in the game, and then
        disappeared. justin, and friends: your contributions are immortalized in the CSS
